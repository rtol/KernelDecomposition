# KernelDecomposition
Matlab routines for decomposing a kernel density into its components

There are two functions, KernelDecompostion.n and DecompositionTest.m, that construct and decompose any kernel and test whether the decomposition is statistically meaningful.

There are also a bunch of scripts necessary to reproduce a paper. These should be run in the order of ReadEstimates.m, Preprocessing.m, ConstructPDF.m, ConstructPDFgrowth.m, Decompose.m. The data are in the Excel spreadsheet.
